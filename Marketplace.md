## Marketplace

The Marketplace is where you can sell/buy or rent/lease your LAMP NFT. 

# Trade System

You can buy and sell LAMP NFT on opensea. 

# Rental System (Under Development)

The main barrier we face to onboarding newcomers into the Club is the complexity of the onboarding process. This starts with creating an Exchange Account, converting fiat to Cryptocurrency and navigating WEb3 with a Decentralized Wallet. We aim to breach this barrier by introducing a Rental System.

By offering a smart rent/lease system, getting started is as easy as visiting our website and renting a LAMP NFT. You will need to apply for rental, and will need to fully agree to the leaser's rental terms before the rental is approved. Each rental contract lasts for 7 days, after which the LAMP NFT will be returned to the owner. A rental Agreement can stretch up to 30 days based on a renter's credit rating. Failure to fulfill the terms stipulated in the Rental Agreement will result in a 1 star deduction from the renter's credit rating.

Whever a renter completes a session, the Smart Contract will distribute the LAMP NFT equivalent to earnings in accordance with the Rental Agreement. The system will reward renters with 0.1 credit per successful Rental Agreement fulfilled.
