# Overview

### [The Arabian Nights Club is the world's first Drama IP NFTs - exclusive membership card offering copyright ownership on drama royalties on future future revenue streams.] 


The allure of filmmaking brings with it visions of posh parties, hobnobbing with the rich and famous, award shows, and dressing up to the nines. There used to be a time when only powerful entertainment moguls could put their money into movie-making ventures, but not anymore. Indeed, there may be a way for you to get in on the action and invest in the potential success of movies, as we are in the middle of great transition in the entertainment business where traditional way of film funding and ownership are being unrooted due to the rapid rise of streamers and other digital platforms.

Arabian Nights Club is the first Web 3.0 DAO Community Platform Protocol serving as a decentralized filmmaking studio and community treasury equipped themselves with NFTS in the form of LAMP. A community treasury that includes both fans and creators ensures two key features: One, gatekeeping power is decentralized to an undeniably diverse group with a passion for the content being made, and Two, it engages audience members in ways that would turn social media stars green with envy, as these fans-turned-investors are now activated as that asset’s greatest form of marketing and distribution. 

We aim to nudge millions towards a shift in the ownership of intellectual property from the centralized studios to a community of fans, create ‘democratized process’ of filmmaking, and connect the public to Web 3.0, while simultaneously untangling opaque financial accounts through LAMP in the quest for greater transparency. 

LAMP represent the start of a “new era” in filmmaking, distribution, and funding. With LAMP comes executive producer-like perks, like visiting the set, meeting big name talents, getting swag like props, and attending the premiere. LAMP NFT entitles the owner to a share of royalties for the intended movie and TV series, whereby LAMP owners and the activities of the project are written to the public Ethereum Blockchain. Fundamentally, the idea is to share on the upside of the residuals of a film on a long-term basis.





Note: LAMP is currently under Public Beta Phase, so contents in the Whitepaper could be changed in the future.
