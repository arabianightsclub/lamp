## LAMP Quality

There are four LAMP qualities. When LAMP is minted, the value of each Attribute will be chosen within the min. and max. values according to LAMP quality. As such, even LAMPs of the same quality may have vastly different Attribute distributions. 

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">

| Quality      | Min. Attribute   | Max. Attribute   | Level Up      |
|:-------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|:--------------|
| Loyal        | 1                | 10               | 4             |
| Super        | 8                | 35               | 6             |
| Epic         | 28           `   | 63               | 10            |
| Legendary    | 50               | 100              | 12            |


Each level-up requires a fixed time to complete, which increases along with the amount of LAMP required according to the LAMP level. Upon level-up, fans will attain 4-12 additional Attribute points to assign according to their LAMP quality. 


Additional perks will be unlocked upon reaching certain level milestones:

At Level 30, you have the option of using LAMP to customize it, including but not limited to - name changing, adding a quote, adding extra Attribute points etc. More detail about customization will be released soon.
